### Overview

Welcome to this repository, which is a collection of personal scripts I've made to use on my classroom workstation.

### Notes

Anyone is welcome to use this code in their Houdini projects. So far, it's extremely basic, and easy to follow along. I will try to put a few comments here and there for readability.

### Shelf-Tools

[Shelf tools folder](https://github.com/SirClarks/LB-Scripts/tree/master/shelf_tools) This is probably the section you'll be most interested in. You can easily copy-paste the code in these files into the script tab of a new shelf tool. For more info on creating custom shelf tools visit the sidefx documentation here: [edit tool window](http://www.sidefx.com/docs/houdini/ref/windows/edittool.html)

### External

Certain snippets of code have been directly borrowed from user posts on either [sidefx forums](https://www.sidefx.com/forum/), [odforce](https://forums.odforce.net/), or [stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/). All excellent learning resources!
