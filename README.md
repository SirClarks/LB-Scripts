### Overview

Welcome to this repository, which is a collection of personal scripts I've made to use on my classroom workstation.

### Notes

Anyone is welcome to use this code in their Houdini projects. So far, it's extremely basic, and easy to follow along. I will try to put a few comments here and there for readability.

### External

Certain snippets of code have been probably directly borrowed from posts on sidefx, odforce, or stackexchange. All excellent learning resources!
